1. What is Simulation(some problems)
Alice and Bob are standing on a 2D plane. Alice starts at the point (0, 0), and Bob starts at the point (R, S) (1 ≤ R, S ≤ 1000). Every second, Alice moves M units to the right, and N units up. Every second, Bob moves P units to the left, and Q units down.
(1 ≤ M, N, P, Q ≤ 10). Determine if Alice and Bob will ever meet (be at the same point at the same time), and if so, when.

There are N buckets (5 ≤ N ≤ 105), each with a certain capacity Ci(1 ≤ Ci≤ 100). One day, after a rainstorm, each bucket is filled with Aiunits of water (1 ≤ Ai≤ Ci). Charlie then performs the following process: he pours bucket 1 into bucket 2, then bucket 2 into bucket 3, and so on, up until pouring bucket N − 1 into bucket N. 
When Charlie pours bucket B into bucket B + 1, he pours as much as possible until bucket B is empty or bucket B + 1 is full. Find out how much water is in each bucket once Charlie is done pouring.

3. Write code using Simulation
